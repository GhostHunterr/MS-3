Today's Progress:
- Explored C++ concepts: classes, inheritance, file handling.
- Worked on Workstation & LineManager modules in C++.
- Faced file reading challenges, resolved with debugging.
- Used STL algorithms for efficient object operations.
- Plan to improve move semantics and error handling.
- Aim to enhance code readability and skills in C++.

Reflection:
Today's coding session was productive, focusing on C++ fundamentals and implementing modules. 
Encountered file handling issues but solved them through careful debugging. Learning to use STL algorithms efficiently 
for object operations was valuable. Looking forward to refining move semantics and error handling for better code quality. 
Overall, feeling more confident and excited about advancing C++ skills!
